# eagler-actions

eagler-actions is a way to run eaglercraft servers with Github Actions. currently this is skidded off my ultraviolet version of this but it should more or less work the same. it will only last 6 hours and the link will be ran with the npm package ```localtunnel``` and should work with wss (WebSocket Secure)

just put your localtunnel address in the server address. if there are **any bugs please dm me my discord tag is KingOfNetflix#7044**
