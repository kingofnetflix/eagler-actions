# eagler-actions

**CURRENTLY NOT DONE**

eagler-actions is a way to run eaglercraft servers with Github Actions. currently this is skidded off my ultraviolet version of this but it should more or less work the same. it will only last 6 hours and the link will die if there is no activity in a hour, it should automatically work with wss (WebSocket Secure) sense it uses a npm package ```localtunnel```

just put your localtunnel address in the server address. the server wont work immediatly so wait maybe 2 or 3 minutes before connecting and as always, if there are any bugs, **please dm me my discord tag is KingOfNetflix#7044**
